# No-Adult-Left-Behind

Inspired by a meme post by @ericnakagawa:

'''Website idea:

You input the year you graduated high school and the website generates a list of outdated "facts" and concepts you were taught in school that have since been disproven.

Planning on how to make 'No Adult Left Behind' 

See the wiki for ideas.
